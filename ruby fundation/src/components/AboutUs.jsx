        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to our platform, a dedicated space for the adoption and rescue of lost, abandoned, 
            or stray animals. Our goal is to provide a safe and loving environment for animals while 
            connecting them with caring families who are ready to give them a forever home. We also 
            assist in locating lost pets, helping reunite them with their owners, and promoting 
            responsible pet ownership in our community.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
            Our mission is to rescue, protect, and rehome animals in need, ensuring they receive the 
            care, love, and medical attention they deserve. We strive to raise awareness about 
            responsible pet ownership and create a supportive community dedicated to animal welfare.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>
            Our vision is a world where every animal has a loving home, no pet is left abandoned, 
            and communities actively participate in the well-being and protection of animals. 
            We aim to be a leading platform for animal rescue and adoption, inspiring compassion 
            and responsible care for all pets.
